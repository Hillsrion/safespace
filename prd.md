#### System Integration Points

- Authentication service â†” Database
- Media processing pipeline â†” Storage service (secure, access-controlled)
- Email delivery system â†” User management (for invites)
- Search indexing â†” Content management
- Moderation tools â†” Content/User systems
- Logging and analytics hooks for adoption and user flows.

#### API Access & Security

- The API is designed for first-party client consumption by the SafeSpace web application.
- Access is protected through:
  - **Authentication:** All private routes require valid session tokens (cookies).
  - **Authorization:** Role-based permissions are enforced at the API level for all actions.
  - **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** Configured to primarily allow requests from the application's own domain.
  - **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) Protection:** Implemented for all state-changing requests (e.g., form submissions), typically handled by RR7.
- These measures ensure that the API is not an open public interface and is secured against common web vulnerabilities and unauthorized external application access.

#### Considerations:

- **Row-Level Security (RLS):** PostgreSQL RLS will be crucial for enforcing that users can only access data within spaces they are members of and according to their role.
- **Full-Text Search:** For fields like `ReportedEntity.name`, `ReportedEntityHandle.handle`, and `Post.description`, PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search capabilities will be used initially. Indexes like GIN or GIST will be necessary.
- **Anonymity:** If `Post.authorId` is NULL for anonymous posts, ensure RLS policies and application logic respect this.
- **Data Deletion:** Cascade deletes or application-level logic must handle data removal when users leave spaces or delete accounts, respecting data retention policies.
- **UUIDs as Primary Keys:** Good for distributed systems and preventing enumeration attacks, but can have slight performance implications if not indexed properly.
- **Timestamps:** `createdAt` and `updatedAt` on most tables for auditing and tracking.

### Narrative

Samira, a rising model, is concerned when receiving a message from a new photographer. Her friend, an established model and Admin of a SafeSpace community, invites her to their private space as an Editor. She signs up in one click using a linkâ€”available for only 24 hoursâ€”feeling reassured by the privacy, invite-only nature, and the Code of Conduct she accepts.

Upon logging in, Samiraâ€™s landing page reveals recent posts made by trusted peers in her space. Sheâ€™s greeted with a clear search bar (`Cmd+K` also works) and quickly searches the photographerâ€™s name and Instagram handle (who is a type of "reported entity" the system tracks). Within seconds, she discovers a detailed reportâ€”complete with screenshots and text, corroborated by other postsâ€”describing concerning behavior by the same photographer. Grateful, she decides to avoid the session and thanks her friend for the invitation. Later, after an unrelated incident, she uses the "Add Report" feature to share her own experience. Realizing she made a typo, she easily finds her post and uses the "Edit" button to correct it.

Meanwhile, the spaceâ€™s Admin monitors who is joining (using the "Invite User" flow) and what is posted, with the power to moderate content (including editing posts if necessary) or users (including "Remove User from Space" if necessary). The Super Admin, overseeing all SafeSpace communities, quietly ensures that every space remains safe, private, and on-missionâ€”ready to step in at the earliest sign of abuse or misuse, manage spaces, or handle system-wide issues. The result: private, empowered, and safer communities, where transparency and anonymity (when chosen) walk hand-in-hand.

### Success Metrics

- **Security**:
  - Zero data breaches.
  - 100% compliance with encryption requirements for sensitive data.
  - Platform uptime (aim: 99.9%).
- **Trust & Safety**:
  - > 80% user satisfaction with platform safety measures (survey-based).
  - Rate of posts flagged and reviewed effectively.
- **Growth & Adoption**:
  - Invitation acceptance rate >75%.
  - Space creation and growth rate (via super admin dashboard).
- **Engagement**:
  - Weekly active users (WAU) >60% of total user base per space.
  - Number of unique searches performed and posts read per user.
  - Frequency of new, credible posts (with evidence).
  - Frequency of post edits (indicating users are maintaining accuracy).
- **Impact**:
  - Documented cases of prevented harm based on shared information (qualitative feedback).
- **Usability**:
  - Task completion rate >90% for core user flows (e.g., creating/editing a post, searching, inviting user).
  - Median page load time (<2.5 seconds).
  - Media upload success rate (>98%).
  - Auth failure rate (<1% of login attempts).

**Tracking Plan:**

- Track "invite accepted" vs "invite sent" events (conversion rate, expiry rates).
- Every post creation and edit (flagging if evidence uploaded, anonymity status).
- All moderation actions (hide, unhide, delete, edit by mod/admin, flagged-for-review resolutions).
- Search queries and search-result clickthroughs.
- Space/user CRUD operations (adds, edits, removals by Admins/Super Admins).
- Media upload/download success/errors.
- User role changes.

---

### Governance & Operations

- Monthly security audits and penetration testing (post-MVP).
- Quarterly review of moderation policies and effectiveness.
- Transparent reporting to community on platform status (anonymized, aggregated).
- Regular training and guidelines for moderators and administrators.
- Clear escalation paths for security, safety concerns, and policy violations.

---

### Technical Considerations (Additional)

- **Data Storage & Privacy:**
  - All personal data minimized.
  - Media files rigorously access-controlled; deleted immediately upon content removal or account deletion as per policy.
  - Robust audit trail for data access and administrative actions (including post edits).
- **Scalability & Performance:**
  - Spaces designed for ~500 users each initially; architecture should allow for scaling.
  - Load-tested media upload/download to prevent bottlenecks.
- **Potential Challenges:**
  - Preventing abuse of the platform (e.g., false reporting, malicious actors). Mitigation: Rigorous invite system, human moderation, evidence requirements, audit logs.
  - Mitigating false reporting: Manual evidence review, community flagging, multi-tiered review for severe allegations.
  - Handling account takeover or malicious admin: Super Admin oversight, robust audit logging, potential for multi-sig operations for critical Super Admin actions in the future.
  - Edge cases: Large/broken media files, vanishing Instagram handles (need ability to update/add aliases), accidental user removal (soft delete/recovery options for Admins).
  - Maintaining anonymity: Ensuring no technical leakage of identifying information when anonymity is chosen, even through edit histories if they become more detailed.

---

### Future Considerations

- API for trusted partner integrations (e.g., agency verification systems).
- Enhanced analytics for pattern detection (e.g., multiple low-severity reports on one reported entity).
- Multi-language support across the platform.
- Advanced threat modeling and proactive protection mechanisms.
- Expanded community tools for peer support and discussion (within privacy constraints).
- Content contest/dispute mechanics with a structured resolution process.
- Formalized legal review of Terms of Service and policies.
- Implementation of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
- Rate limiting on all critical endpoints.
- **Version history for edited reports/posts.**
- Automated detection of potentially problematic content using AI/ML.
- In-app notification center and expanded email notification options.
- Saved searches and alerts for specific handles.
- Advanced Instagram handle verification (e.g., API lookups).
